# MondayNightGrinder
A level grinder for Super Monday Night Combat, you would open the game to the solo pve menu and leave this to run till you reached a level you wanted.
This is a very dirty hack job with hard coded varibles for where and what to click so this would probably only work with a 1920x1080 resolution screen.

This is probably no longer useful as the game Super Monday Night Combat was shut down a while back.
